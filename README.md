## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

hmm, that i've alot to learn and it excites me.

### Continued development

while coding i found it difficult utilizing some css selectors or should i say when i'm supposed to use and where to place them. it did take me a very long time to complete maybe it because i was stalling or should i say scared that i had hit a block of sort while coding. anyways at kept me going 'All that matters is i've put in my time and hit it with all i've got. All that counts is that, for this day, for this session, i have overcome resistance'

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com) basically helped with css part of the code construction.
- (https://www.freecodecamp.com) - i had to learn a thing or two about github, watched some youtube videos from their channel and article reading on some part of css.
